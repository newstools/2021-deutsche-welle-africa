The men were found guilty of rioting as well as wounding with intent or conspiracy to wound with intent.

"They collectively took the law into their own hands and put residents in extreme terror," Yip added. Dubbed the 'Yuen Long' mob attacks, more than a hundred men dressed in white and wielding sticks had pounced on pro-democracy supporters at a train station in Yuen Long, a town close to the rural border with mainland China. The attackers injured at least 45 people, including ordinary commuters and reporters.

Police have denied any wrongdoing, saying that their resources were stretched thin due to anti-government protests elsewhere.
