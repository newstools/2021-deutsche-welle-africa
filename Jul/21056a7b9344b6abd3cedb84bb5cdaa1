Twelve members of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Cabinet tendered their resignations Wednesday as the government faces ongoing criticism over its disastrous COVID-19 response. President Ram Nath Kovind's office said the resignations were accepted on orders of the prime minister. Among those to step down were Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and Information and Broadcast Minister Prakash Javadekar. The group also included Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, known for spearheading the government's row with large tech companies such as Twitter and WhatsApp. Later in the day, Modi swore in 43 new Cabinet members in a major reshuffle that saw at least six junior members promoted. The Cabinet was also enlarged to 77 members from the previous 52. Wednesday's departures signal the first change to Modi's Cabinet since he was reelected to a second term in 2019 and ahead of important state elections early next year. It also comes as the country attempts to speed its vaccination program while bracing for another possible wave of infections. India has logged more than 400,000 COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began, the world's third-highest death toll behind the US and Brazil.
