Two astronauts made the first space walk outside China's new orbital station on Sunday morning, state media reported. Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo's space walk comes just weeks after they and crew member, Nie Haisheng, became the first astronauts to arrive at the station, on a three-month mission. Liu and Tang were shown by state TV climbing out of the airlock. They were tasked with elevating a panoramic camera outside the Tianhe core module of the Tiangong space station. They also had to verify the 15-meter (50-foot) robotic arm's transfer capability, state media said. The astronauts trained for around 6000 hours for the mission to the space station Television footage showed the astronauts preparing for the spacewalk by donning gear and conducting health checks while exercising in the cabin. The space walk was expected to last around six hours. It is the first of two planned for the mission. As well as carrying out space walks, the crew members are carrying out experiments, conducting maintenance and preparing the station for two more modules scheduled to launch next year.
