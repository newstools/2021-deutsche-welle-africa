He emphasized the need for cooperation, "now that the hostile forces become more desperate in their challenge and obstructive moves," in a possible reference to the US. Last week, the North Korean leader had congratulated the Chinese President on the 100th founding anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, while condemning "hostile forces" for slandering the party.

The two nations signed a friendship treaty on July 11,1961, against the backdrop of the Korean War. The isolated country is dependent on China for trade, and recovery for its current economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. Ties between the two nations have fluctuated over the years due to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The relationship has been rekindled in recent years, as Xi and Kim have met five times. Experts say the latest messages of friendship are aimed at the US. Washington-Beijing ties have been strained over the years, and nuclear talks between the US and North Korea have come to a standstill.   tg/aw (AFP, AP, Reuters)
