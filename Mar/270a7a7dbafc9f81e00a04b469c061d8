Just days after Borussia Mönchengladbach's under-23 coach was reportedly ordered to train the women's team as a punishment, Germany's top female players have demanded more clarity from the sport's governing body. In an open letter shared on Instagram, players from the country's top two divisions asked for clarification. "This verdict discriminates [against] all women in sport, especially in football," the letter read. Heiko Vogel's behavior was "far more than just unsportsmanlike, it was offensive and discriminatory." The players called on the German Football Association (DFB) to be active. "We ask you, as the highest institution in German football, to take a stand and be active. We feel insulted, discriminated and ridiculed." Vogel was banned from the dugout for two matches after unsportsmanlike behavior against two female assistant referees. Vanessa Arlt, one of those assistants, told the local Westfälischen Nachrichten newspaper that as Vogel left the pitch he said "women have no place on the football field." Vogel, 44, was also fined €1,500 ($1,792) and ordered to coach a women's or girls' team. Borussia Mönchengladbach told German publication Spiegel that neither the club or Vogel see the decision as punishment. It was suggested by the club as a symbol of the apology included in part of the verdict. Gladbach's under-23 coach Heiko Vogel In fact, the club's sporting director, Max Eberl, said that Vogel himself suggested the idea of training a women's team "in order to express his appreciation for women's football. In this sense it's not a punishment, but rather an offer." The club went on to say that Vogel has apologized to those involved and has acknowledged his mistake, explained his misconduct by citing the emotion of the game and that he subsequently found his remarks unpleasant and embarrassing. Nevertheless, the local football association, the Western German FA (WDFV), announced on Friday that they were going to investigate the verdict.
