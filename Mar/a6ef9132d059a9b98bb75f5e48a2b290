The head of the World Health Organization blasted growing vaccine inequality on Monday. The gap in the number of vaccinations administered in rich and poor countries was "growing every single day, and becoming more grotesque every day," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "Some countries are racing to vaccinate their entire populations, while other countries have nothing," Tedros said. The head of the UN health body added that this approach was giving rich countries a false sense of security. Tedros has frequently warned that if the virus spreads unhindered in some parts of the world, mutations and variants can pose a threat everywhere. Many rich countries have pledged to support the COVAX global vaccine-sharing initiative to give poorer countries access to vaccines, but few so far have shared their stocks. While many low-income countries have not yet received a single vaccine dose, some wealthier countries have ordered enough doses to inoculate their populations twice.

Uruguay has confirmed that it has detected the presence of two coronavirus variants that originated in neighboring Brazil. Early studies suggest they can overcome some antibodies, increase a person's chances of reinfection and decrease the efficacy of vaccines, meaning the variants are tougher to tackle. Brazil's Health Ministry has recorded over 49,000 new cases of coronavirus and 1,383 new COVID-19 deaths. The country has the world's highest daily caseload at present as it battles the two virus mutations. On March 22, the entry rules into Germany were tightened again.

You can now visit Majorca again without needing to quarantine or take a test once you’ve returned to Germany. Bookings have increased significantly, and more flights are being added.

Norbert Fiebig, president of the German Travel Association (DRV), has urged that it is "time for a coordinated approach to restore safe travel." He is counting on vaccination certificates and rapid coronavirus tests – strategies also promoted by politicians. The EU decided on February 25, for instance, to have introduced standardized vaccination passports for travelers by the summer. Greece and Israel signed an agreement (Feb 9) to that will allow vaccinated tourists to travel between their two countries withthout restrictions. In Europe, whether vaccinated people should be the first to be allowed to travel again is controversial. While Germany is still reluctant, some countries already allow easier entry with a vaccination certificate, including Estonia, Poland and Iceland. Just how disastrous the 2020 travel year was is made clear in the latest survey by the UN tourism organization UNWTO: 74% decline in global tourism worldwide, with over a hundred million jobs tied to it.

Despite extended coronavirus restrictions in Italy, as of Monday (Jan 18), museums and exhibitions in some regions will be able to reopen. This rule applies to the so-called Yellow Zones, where the coronavirus infection situation is less tense. Among others, the Archaeological Park in Pompeii is again able to receive visitors because it is located in the yellow region of Campania.

That is less than a third of the normal number allowed. Rio de Janeiro's famous annual Carnival spectacle will not go ahead in February.
