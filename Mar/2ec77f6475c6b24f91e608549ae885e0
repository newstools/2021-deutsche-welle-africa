Authorities issued a tsunami warning for Japan on Saturday after a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck off the coast of Miyagi prefecture. The first tsunami waves of up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) hit land shortly after the earthquake, local television channel NHK reported. Officials said that there were no immediate reports of injury or major damage. At least 200 households were left without electricity. The Tohoku Electric Power Co reportedly shut down its Onagawa nuclear plant as it checked for any irregularities, while theÂ Tokyo Electric Power checked on the condition of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi power station, which was wrecked by the 2011 quake. The US Consulate in Sapporo told people in the area to "seek higher ground." Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) said that the quake hit at 6:09 p.m. local time (09:09 GMT/UTC) at a depth of 60 kilometers (37 miles) in the Pacific water just off the coast of the Miyagi region. Tremors were also felt in the capital, Tokyo. A video shared by NHK showed how the earthquake was felt in Sendai city in Miyagi prefecture. Saturday's earthquake came not long after the country marked ten years since the deadly 9.0-magnitude quake on March 11, 2011, also affecting the Miyagi region. The event a decade ago led to a catastrophic triple disaster as a disastrous tsunami was unleashed and the Fukushima nuclear plant went into meltdown. Many people were injured last month when another strong earthquake struck. Japan is on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," an area along the edge of the Pacific ocean which is characterized by strong seismic activity. Construction regulations in Japan mean that buildings must be built to withstand the frequent earthquakes. This is a breaking news story and will be updated as more details become available.
