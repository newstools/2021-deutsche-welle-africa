The European Union agreed on Monday to sanction China for human rights abuses against the Uyghurs at a foreign ministers meeting Monday in Brussels. Four party and regional representatives, as well as an organization from Xinjiang province, are due to be added to the EU sanctions list. Their names will be published in the EU Official Journal before the end of Monday, sources close to the talks said. The EU has not issued punitive sanctions on China for human rights abuses since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. It came as EU foreign ministers agreed on a series of different sanctions against various countries and entities.

Mass rapes and the forced sterilization of women are also alleged to have taken place in the camps. Beijing says the camps — which are estimated to have held more than 1 million people since 2017 — are "vocational education centers" to prevent extremism and terrorism.
