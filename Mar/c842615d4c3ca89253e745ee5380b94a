Germany is the main focus of Russian disinformation in the EU,  the bloc's diplomatic service revealed on Tuesday. A new report found targeted campaigns both at the political level and through media close to the Kremlin. The EUvsDisinfo database found that since late 2015, more than 700 cases of Russian disinformation have been collected on Germany. The report stated that: Russian media and politicians have used news stories, particularly about Russian children, to accuse the German authorities of systematically suppressing Russians in Germany. Similar negative news stories about Germany are omitted from the German-language versions of the same Russian media. Such Russian "doublespeak" is systematic and deliberate. The strategy sows uncertainty and discord, and leaves Russian officials more room to maneuver, the report stated. The Kremlin and the Foreign Ministry have showed a willingness to enter into a dialogue, while allowing attacks on Germany and other EU countries via Russian media outlets.

The EU's European External Action Service analyses publicly available media reports and statements on the EUvsDisinfo database. The database currently comprises over 6,500 samples of pro-Kremlin disinformation and is updated weekly. dpa contributed to this report
