Tiger Woods said on Tuesday he has left hospital and is recovering at home after being seriously injured in a car crash in Los Angeles last month. In a statement released via social media, the 45-year-old golf superstar thanked hospital staff who cared for him following his single vehicle car accident on February 23. "Happy to report that I am back home and continuing my recovery," Woods said. "I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks." Woods suffered serious injuries when his car flew off the road and flipped several times during last month's accident.
