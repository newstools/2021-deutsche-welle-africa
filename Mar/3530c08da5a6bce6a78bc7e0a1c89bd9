Swedish police are investigating a knife attack that took place Wednesday in the southern town of Vetlanda as a possible "terror crime," authorities said. Police said at least eight people were injured, but so far no fatalities have been reported. Earlier, police said they shot and arrested a man in his 20s after he apparently stabbed several people in Vetlanda, about 190 kilometers (118 miles) southeast of Goteborg — Sweden's second largest city. One suspect is in custody, according to officials. The motive was not immediately clear. According to Swedish newspaper the Aftonblade, police spokesperson Angelica Israelsson Silfver said ''Some are seriously injured and some are slightly injured, but no one is dead." mvb (AP, dpa, Reuters)
