The collective includes the leading opposition party Pastef, whose leader Ousmane Sonko was arrested on rape charges on Wednesday. An employee of a beauty salon accused Sonko, who finished third in the 2019 presidential election, of raping her. Sonko is accused of rape by an employee of a beauty salon. He is due in court on Monday to face questions over the charge. The opposition leader's largely younger supporters have voiced anger over his arrest and the court case against him. The 46-year-old is considered a key potential challenger to incumbent President Sall in the next elections in 2024. Presidents in the former French colony are limited to two consecutive terms, but 59-year-old Sall launched a constitutional review in 2016, raising suspicions he intends to run for a third term. Critics say the rape charge against Sonko was fabricated in a bid to remove a political rival should Sall decide to change the constitution and run for a third term. see/rs (AFP, Reuters)
