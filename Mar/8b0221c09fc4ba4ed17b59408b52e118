After Alphonso Davies was sent off 12 minutes in with the scores still deadlocked, Stuttgart must've felt they had a chance of taking something from the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Three chances, three shots and three goals from Robert Lewandowski later, with a Serge Gnabry effort thrown in for good measure, it became another exercise in damage limitation. The 4-0 scoreline Bayern had on 39 minutes was the one they ended with. Lewandowski stabbed home Gnabry's driven ball for the first, headed Thomas Müller's cross in to the top corner for the second and danced through the visiting defense to score his third with a low drive. That effort was number 35 for the Bundesliga season, leaving him five short of equaling Gerd Müller's record for goals in a single season (1971-72). There are eight games left this season. Whether he does or not, and it's difficult to bet against him, at 32 he is only getting more lethal. Here are just a few indicators of his incredible plundering. 7 - Teams who have scored less goals than Lewandowski this year 5 - Times as many goals as second-placed RB Leipzig's top scorer, Angelino. 4 - Hat tricks this season, one of which saw him score 4. 3 - Times he's started and failed to score in the current campaign. 1 - Bundesliga team he has failed to score against this season, RB Leipzig, who Bayern play next weekend. 60 - Minutes per goal, on average. 5 - Amount of times he's finished the season as the Bundesliga's top scorer, including the last three. 0 - Games missed through injury in 2020-21. 6 - Seasons in a row he's passed the 20 goal mark. He also did it in three of his four seasons at Dortmund. 197 - League goals for Bayern, in 215 games. A member of the 2014 German team that won the World Cup, Thomas Müller is knocking on the door of the top 10. At the age of 19, Müller scored his first of 47 Champions League goals for Bayern Munich in a 7-1 win over Sporting Lisbon in March 2009. He won the Champions League twice with Bayern, in 2012-13 and 2019-20 (*as of March 15, 2021) Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 48 goals in the Champions League have been spread over six different clubs: Ajax (6 goals), Juventus (3), Inter Milan (6), Barcelona (4), AC Milan (9) and Paris Saint-Germain (20). Despite all that club hopping, he has never managed to be with the right team at the right time to lift the Champions League trophy. (*as of March 15, 2021) Like Ibrahimovic, the Ukrainian, who has long since ended his career, scored 48 times in the Champions League. Unlike the Swede, though, he won the title – with AC Milan in 2002-03. The striker scored 29 Champions League goals for Milan, 15 for Dynamo Kyiv and four for Chelsea. The Argentine striker (right) helped Real Madrid become champions of Europe five years running between 1956 and 1960, when the competition was still a straight knock-out tournament known as the European Cup. Alfredo di Stefano, who passed away in 2014, was regarded as one of the best players in the world during his 11 years at Real, between 1953 and 1964. The French striker cracked the half-century mark over his long career in the Champions League, finding the back of the net for three clubs: Monaco (7 goals), Arsenal (35) and Barcelona (8). Having won the World Cup with France in 1998, Henry would also go on to win the Champions League with Barca in 2008-09. Dutch striker Rutgerus Johannes Martinus van Nistelrooij scored for three clubs in the Champions League: PSV Eindhoven (8 goals), Manchester United (35) and Real Madrid (13). Van Nistelrooy failed to win a Champions League title, but he was the top scorer in Europe's top competition in three different seasons. The Frenchman made his scoring debut in the Champions League for Lyon at the tender age of 18. Karim Benzema left Lyon in 2009 and has since helped Real Madrid lift the Champions League trophy four times. He has a total of 69 goals in Europe's most prestigious club competition. (*as of March 16, 2021) Raul is truly a legend at Real Madrid. The long-time captain made more appearances for Real than any other player, with 550 games in La Liga and 132 in the Champions League. He also led Real to the Champions League title three times. Raul scored five of his 71 Champions League goals during his two-year stint with Schalke in the twilight of his career. In third place in the all-time scorer's list is The Best FIFA Men's Player of 2020, Robert Lewandowski. The Poland striker secured that honor in part by becoming the top scorer in the Champions League in 2019-20 with 15 goals. Over his Champions League career he has found the back of the net 17 times for Borussia Dortmund and 56 times for Bayern. (*as of March 17, 2021) Even if Barcelona aren't the outfit they once were, there's one thing that remains a constant – Lionel Messi's nose for goal. The diminutive Argentine has scored 120 goals in his Champions League career so far. He has been the competition's top scorer six times and has led Barca to the title three times. (*as of March 15, 2021) It's no coincidence that the Portuguese superstar has won the Champions League five times. Wherever he has played, whether it be Manchester United (15 goals), Real Madrid (105) or now Juventus (14) – Cristiano Ronaldo has always found the back of the net. With 134 goals, Ronaldo is the undisputed top scorer in Europe's top club competition. (*as of March 15, 2021) Author: Stefan Nestler
