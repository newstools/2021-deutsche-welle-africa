The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) lifted its 2021 global growth forecast on Tuesday to 5.6%. The deployment of coronavirus vaccines and a huge US stimulus program have greatly improved the world's economic prospects. Tuesday's figure is an increase of 1.4% fromthe Paris-based organization's December forecast. It is welcome news for the world economy. It plunged into recession last year, when governments introduced restrictions to curb the coronavirus pandemic.

Chief economist Laurence Boone said the top priority should now be to produce coronavirus vaccines. She warned delays and further coronavirus mutations that defy treatment could weaken the expected recovery. Fully deploying vaccines "throughout the world" as quickly as possible would "save lives, preserve incomes and limit the adverse impact of containment measures on well-being,'' the report said. kmm/rt (AP, dpa)
