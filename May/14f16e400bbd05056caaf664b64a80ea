In the first episode of season two, James chats to legendary goalkeeper Lutz Pfannenfstiel about what it was like traveling the world to play football as a German? Did his nationality affect his experiences, did he miss Germany and what has he brought from Germany to help him in his role as sporting director at MLS expansion franchise St. Louis City SC? All that and some penguins in this episode. Thanks for listening. If you want to get in touch then drop us a line via Twitteror Instagram.
