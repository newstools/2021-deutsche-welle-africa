At least 12 people were killed and more than 400 injured as a storm system ripped through central and eastern China Friday night. Eight people died and 280 were injured in Wuhan, the capital of China’s central Hubei province, where COVID-19 was first detected in late 2019. Local officials said the tornado hit around 8:40 p.m. local time (1240 UTC/GMT), damaging construction sites, toppling 27 houses and snapping several trees. At least 130 houses were damaged. About 90 minutes before the Wuhan twister, another tornado struck the eastern town of Shengze, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the east in Jiangsu province. Officials said four people were killed. One person was missing and 149 injured. The strong winds damaged electricity facilities and damaged several factory buildings, local officials said. Rescue team members work through the rubble of collapsed buildings in Wuhan China's Jiangsu province often sees tornadoes in the late spring and early summer. The country’s commercial hub of Shanghai, nearly 100 kilometers from Shengze, was also hit by powerful thunderstorms, prompting weather officials to issue an alert. see/wmr (AP, Reuters)
