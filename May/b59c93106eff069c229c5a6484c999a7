Max Verstappen won the Monaco Grand Prix for the first time to take the Formula One championship lead from Lewis Hamilton on Sunday, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who was due to start on pole,Â pulled out just before the race started.

His teammate Valtteri Bottas went from second place to out of the race before the midway point after his team botched a tire change. More to follow.
