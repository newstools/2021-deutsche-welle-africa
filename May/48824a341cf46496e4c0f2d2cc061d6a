The Japanese car manufacturer announced on Wednesday that it was selling its 1.54% stake in the German auto giant Daimler. The sale of the company's share followed a similar move by Nissan's French partner Renault. The 16.4 million shares were sold at €69.85 ($83.74) to professional investors, bringing in around €1.15 billion for the Japanese company. Nissan said the divestment would allow it to "further strengthen and enhance its business competitiveness, including investments to promote electrification."

The Japanese automaker maintains a partnership with Renault and Mitsubishi. The French car manufacturer Renault announced a record loss in 2020, hit hard by the pandemic, after which it sold its entire 1.54% share in Daimler.

The German car manufacturer had been working with Renault-Nissan on the joint production of motors.
