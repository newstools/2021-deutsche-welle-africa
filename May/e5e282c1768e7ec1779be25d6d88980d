The use of body paint to highlight, enhance or symbolize something has a history that dates back thousands of years. For example, mehndi, a ceremonial art form using henna, has been practiced on the Indian Subcontinent for centuries. Today, henna hand tattoos are popular. The dye is not permanent and will fade after a few hours or days.  Body painting can be done a number of ways. Are there any you’ve tried or would like to try? We’d like to hear about it!  And as a thank you, one participant will receive a backpack full of items produced exclusively for DW.  This is the kind of body painting I’d like to try / have tried: The deadline is 21 May 2021, 12 noon UTC. Our decisions are final. Good luck!
