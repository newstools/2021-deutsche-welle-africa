Police in the northern German city of Hamburg cleared out parts of a popular district on Saturday night after an illegal rave party in a nearby park spilled into the streets. According to German media reports, between 1,300 to 1,500 people attended the party in Flora Park , located in Hamburg's "Schanzenviertel" neighborhood, which is well-known for its vibrant nightlife. Police dispersed the revelers after it became clear that many people were breaking coronavirus regulations by not observing social distancing or wearing face masks. After the park was cleared, people then spilled into the streets of nearby neighborhoods. The NDR public broadcaster reported that some threw bottles at the police, and were jumping on cars. Several people were arrested. Revelers are cleared from the Schanzenviertel district Police then began to clear the streets, and cut off access to parts of the Schanzenviertel.
