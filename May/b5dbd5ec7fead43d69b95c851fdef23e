A British activist who has played a key role in anti-racism protests in Britain is in critical condition after being shot in the head in London, her political party said. The Taking the Initiative Party said Sasha Johnson was shot on Sunday. They said she previously recieved "numerous death threats as a result of her activism.'' The recently-founded party said Johnson was a "strong, powerful voice for our people and our community." "Sasha has always been actively fighting for black people and the injustices that surround the Black community, as well as being both a member of BLM (Black Lives Matter) and a member of Taking the Initiative Party's Executive Leadership Committee," the party said in an Instagram post.
