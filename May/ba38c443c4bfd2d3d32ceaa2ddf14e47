Taiwan raised the coronavirus alert level for the capital Taipei and New Taipei cities to Level 3, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said on Saturday. The new steps come amidst a rise in domestic infections. "Only by doing this can infections be dealt with and controlled," Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters. With 180 new domestic cases recorded late Friday, authorities have issued the new alert, which will run through May 28. Taiwan has a four-tier alert system but this is the first time that a Level 3 alert has been imposed. Under the new alert, residents have to wear masks at all times when they leave their homes. While outdoor gatherings have been limited to 10 people, more than five people are not allowed to assemble indoors. It stops short of a full lockdown. The recent spike in cases has spooked the residents of Taiwan, months after authorities were hailed for their swift handling of the coronavirus crisis last year.

With 177 virus-related deaths, the country’s reported death toll rose to 86,025. A poll has found that Germans are against lifting coronavirus-related restrictions for people who have been fully vaccinated.

German health officials have also put Britain back on the list of coronavirus "risk areas" amid fears over the spread of the Indian COVID-19 variant there. The move comes despite the UK's vaccination drive that has seen its citizens taken off travel red lists across the world. China has canceled all attempts to climb Mount Everest from its side over fears of importing virus cases from Nepal, which is currently reeling under a massive COVID-19 outbreak. China had issued permits to 38 Chinese citizens to scale the world’s highest peak, while Nepal has allowed 408 people after climbing was not allowed last year because of the coronavirus. However, several climbers in Nepal tested positive for the virus after they were brought down from the base camp.

New US federal guidelines that allow fully vaccinated Americans to move without masks in most cases have led to some confusion among states and businesses, as they attempt to decipher whether the new approach can be implemented. Many business owners have raised concerns over determining who has been vaccinated and who has not, even as the new guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leave it up to people to do the right thing. Francina Armengol, the President of the Balearic Islands, has issued a preliminary rejection of any hopes for parties on the island of Mallorca this summer. “We can only start to allow places to open and nightlife to return once we have a higher vaccination rate”, Armengol said. Responsible tourism will be prioritized. “Nightlife will follow, but later, and probably not this summer.” Munich's Oktoberfest will be canceled for a second year in a row due to the coronavirus pandemic. The decision was made by Bavarian state Premier Markus Söder and Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter. "In the classic beer tents at the big festivals, social distancing, masks and other measures are practically impossible to implement," Söder said. Reiter said canceling the Oktoberfest again was a great pity. Following the third wave of the coronavirus in Italy, the Vatican Museums reopened on Monday (May 3).

The U.S. has heightened its travel warnings on account of the coronavirus pandemic, now additionally advising against travel to Germany and other EU countries – where the U.S. State Department's has applied its red-alert level. This represents the highest of its four risk-advisory levels for travel. At the third level, previously in force, the advice was only to reconsider any planned travel. Starting at the end of May, Israel wants to let tourists with a Covid-19 vaccination back into the country. Tourists will have to comply with the requirements, which include proof of vaccination and negative Covid-19 test results.

As of April 1, foreign travellers are permitted to enter Croatia again if they can present evidence that they have been vaccinated against coronavirus. In addition, anyone who has a negative PCR test or an antigen test or can prove that they have recovered from Covid-19 within the past six months may also cross the borders. Before, you had to present a negative PCR test or quarantine for ten days. Malta is rapidly progressing with COVID-19 vaccinations and plans to open to tourists on a large scale from June. The island is focusing primarily on outdoor activities such as scuba diving. A total of 20 million euros will be invested in the reopening.

Norbert Fiebig, president of the German Travel Association (DRV), has urged that it is "time for a coordinated approach to restore safe travel." He is counting on vaccination certificates and rapid coronavirus tests – strategies also promoted by politicians. The EU decided on February 25, for instance, to have introduced standardized vaccination passports for travelers by the summer. Greece and Israel signed an agreement (Feb 9) to that will allow vaccinated tourists to travel between their two countries withthout restrictions. In Europe, whether vaccinated people should be the first to be allowed to travel again is controversial. While Germany is still reluctant, some countries already allow easier entry with a vaccination certificate, including Estonia, Poland and Iceland. Just how disastrous the 2020 travel year was is made clear in the latest survey by the UN tourism organization UNWTO: 74% decline in global tourism worldwide, with over a hundred million jobs tied to it.

This rule applies to the so-called Yellow Zones, where the coronavirus infection situation is less tense. Among others, the Archaeological Park in Pompeii is again able to receive visitors because it is located in the yellow region of Campania. It's snowing in the Alps and the lower German mountain ranges. Despite all appeals, people are drawn outdoors.
