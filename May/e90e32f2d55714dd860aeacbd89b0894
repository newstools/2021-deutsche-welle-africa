We're back! Project Fussball returns to investigate German identity through football. What does it mean, how is German football perceived abroad and how has it changed over the years? With help from Lutz Pfannenstiel, Celia Sasic and many others, Project Fussball Â delivers an engaging and timely conversation about what German football really is. Thanks for listening.
