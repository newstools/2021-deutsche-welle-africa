After a two-day crisis meeting, the German Football Association (DFB) called on its president to step down after he had compared Rainer Koch, one of his vice presidents, to infamous Nazi judge Roland Freisler. The association also called for its general secretary, Friedrich Curtius, to resign. Following a crisis meeting, a vote of no-confidence in Keller from the regional soccer bosses ended 26-9, with two abstentions. Curtius lost a similar vote, according to a DFB statement. "The presidents of the state and regional associations of the German Football Association withdrew their confidence in President Fritz Keller at the extraordinary conference this weekend in Potsdam and asked him to step down from his position," the DFB statement said. "The conference also had a vote of no-confidence in general secretary Dr Friedrich Curtius," the DFB added. Meanwhile, Koch and treasurer Stephan Osnabrügge both won votes of confidence. Earlier this week, Keller admitted to having made a "serious mistake" but said he would not leave his post after comparing DFB Vice President Koch with Freisler at a federation meeting on April 23. Freisler, as a participant in the Wannsee Conference of 1942, was one of the Nazis responsible for the organization of the Holocaust. He became president of the People's Court, where he issued around 2,600 death sentences to opponents of the Nazi regime.   jsi/sms (dpa, SID)
