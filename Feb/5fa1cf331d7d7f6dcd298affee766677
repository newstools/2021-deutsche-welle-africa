The legal status of the Netherlands' nightly curfew was thrown into confusion on Tuesday when a district court ruled that the government had failed to justify the use of emergency powers. The government then requested and was granted an emergency injunction order, in which a three-judge appellate panel agreed to suspend the lower court's earlier ruling. The emergency ruling means that the 9:00 pm curfew remains in place. The Netherlands was rocked by nights of violent anti-lockdown and anti-curfew riots in January The higher court's decision stated that the interests of the state in fighting the virus "carry greater weight" than those of the anti-lockdown group, Viruswaarheid (Virus Truth), behind the earlier lawsuit. Willem Engel, the founder of Viruswaarheid, told the judge he was making a "big mistake" by upholding the curfew. Violent anti-lockdown and anti-curfew protests rocked the nation last month. Tensions remain high throughout the country.

"We're very worried about it," he said. "I want to ask everyone in the country to keep to the curfew," he added. The curfew will remain in force pending the outcome of the government's appeal scheduled to be heard on Friday. mb,wd/aw (Reuters, AFP)
