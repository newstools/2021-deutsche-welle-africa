The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, said on Friday he was scrapping a plan to build a new statue in one of the city's central squares after a poll failed to give a clear decision on who should be honored. City authorities had asked residents to vote on two candidates from Russian history for a statue to be placed in Lubyanka Square — including the reinstatement of the statue of the much-feared founder of the Soviet Union's first secret police, a precursor to the KGB.

"The statues which stand on streets and squares should not divide society, but unite it," Sobyanin wrote on his blog. "Hence I consider it correct to abandon this process and leave Lubyanka Square as it is." The poll was held online and voting started on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, around 55% of voters had chosen a statue of the 13th-century prince and saint of the Russian Orthodox Church Alexander Nevsky. Another 45% had opted instead for Felix Dzerzhinsky, the Soviet revolutionary and a key figure in the so-called "Red Terror." Dzerzhinsky had led the Cheka — later the KGB — during the early stages of the Soviet Union. The secret police force was infamous for carrying out executions of political opponents and destroying those it deemed had committed treason. A statue of Dzerzhinsky, known as Iron Felix, had previously stood in front of the former office of the KGB on Lubyanka Square — now the home of the Russian secret service, the FSB. His statue was torn down in August 1991 as crowds cheered after a coup failed to oust then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The Soviet Union ceased to exist a few months after that. His 11-tonne bronze statue now stands in a park of Soviet monuments in central Moscow and is considered part of Russia's cultural heritage.
