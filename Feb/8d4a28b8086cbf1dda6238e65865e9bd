Ryanair on Wednesday lost a legal fight in the European Union's second court against state aid being granted to pandemic-hit rivals Air France and Sweden 's SAS through national schemes. Judges at the EU's General Court in Luxembourg backed EU competition regulators who had allowed the support under loosened rules. The state aid rules of the European Commission — the defendant in the case —were loosened at the start of the pandemic. National governments offered more than 3 trillion euros ($3.65 trillion) in aid to companies across the 27-member bloc. The General Court was asked to assess a French scheme allowing airlines to defer certain aeronautical taxes, and to rule on Sweden's loan guarantee scheme for airlines.

"This aid scheme is appropriate to remedy the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and does not constitute discrimination," the court said, referring to the French scheme. It also said the Swedish scheme was compatible with EU laws. The court said that the limitation of the loan guarantee scheme "is appropriate for achieving the objective of remedying the serious disturbance in Sweden's economy." The losses for Ryanair were just a first round, and the cases could now moving to the higher European Court of Justice.
