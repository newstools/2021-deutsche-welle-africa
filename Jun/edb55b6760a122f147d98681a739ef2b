Cyclones damaged about 1,000 classrooms in Beira in two years. Many students had to study out in the open. The city council suggested an alternative. Repurposed buses as classroom. Transformation of the “machimbombos” takes place in Maputo Province. Beira implements the project with support from the Dutch Embassy. Chota Primary School has five repurposed buses. There is still much to be done to overcome the lack of classrooms. The alternative can help education and it is also eco-friendly.
