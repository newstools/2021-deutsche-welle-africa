Central African Republic (CAR) Prime Minister Firmin Ngrebada said on Thursday that he hadÂ resigned and his government was dissolved. In a post on Twitter, Ngrebada said he handed his resignation to the president, Faustin Archange Touadera. In a Facebook post, Ngrebada hinted the move was related to Touadera's re-election. Touadera was sworn in for a second, five-year term in March after securing re-election in December.

Recent legislative elections left Touadera's United Hearts Movement (MCU) short of a parliamentary majority.

The CAR has been plagued by violence for several years in fighting between government forces and rebel groups. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee over the years due to the violence, spilling into other countries.

Together, they took back control of many areas previously held by rebels. The CAR also faces massive poverty and food insecurity. The UN said about half of the population is affected by "high levels of acute food insecurity." Earlier this week, about 160 French troops who were offering operational support and training for Central African forces suspended their mission, as ties between the CAR and France were falling apart. France halted financial aid to the country on Monday, accusing Bangui of complying with a Russian-linked disinformation campaign against France. Russia has stepped up its efforts in the CAR, as the Kremlin sent weapons and instructors to train the CAR's forces. The country also invested in the CAR's mining sector. The impoverished country is resource rich, with large reserves of gold, diamonds, copper and uranium. Ngrebada, whose critics accuse him of being too close to Vladimir Putin, was in St. Petersburg last week to persuade Russia to invest even more in the country. kbd/msh (AFP, AP, dpa)
