A 9-year-old lioness by the name of Neela has died in an Indian zoo from coronavirus, officials at the Arignar Anna zoological park said on Friday. The state-run zoo, located just outside Chennai, said Neela passed away from COVID-19 on Thursday, while eight other lions also tested positive for the virus. "Samples of tigers and other large mammals are being sent for testing," the statement added.

All the other lions who have tested positive are being kept under close observation by staff. The source of their infection is unclear, although the zoo said that all of its keepers had been vaccinated against coronavirus.
