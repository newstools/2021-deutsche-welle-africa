A former army chief in Uganda has been injured and his daughter and driver killed after gunmen shot at the car in which they were being driven on Tuesday, according to an army spokeswoman and local media reports. General Katumba Wamala, Uganda's former army commander who is the current minister of transport, was attacked near his home in a suburb of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, military spokeswoman Brigadier Flavia Byekwaso told the Reuters news agency. Byekwaso told AP that Wamala's daughter and driver had been confirmed dead since the attack. Four attackers on motorcycles opened fire at the vehicle, local television station NBS reported. "He (Wamala) sustained injuries in both shoulders," lawmaker Chris Baryomunsi told NBS. Shortly before the attack, Wamala posted on Twitter: "I wish you a month of Happiness, Success, Peace, Prosperity, Good Health, and Wealth."
