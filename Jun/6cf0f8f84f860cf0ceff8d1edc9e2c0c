These events are organized by few people. But they've proliferated in the Nigerien capital. The fairs take place after female entrepreneurs are trained. More than 50 women exhibited some 300 items. Handicraft and agricultural products are exhibited for three days. The turnover is up to €15,000. The fairs attract many customers, including foreigners. Whether they are Nigeriens or foreigners, everyone finds talent here. Customers used to buy products in conventional stores. Now, they look for quality at these alternative markets.
