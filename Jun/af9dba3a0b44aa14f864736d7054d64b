The German army (Bundeswehr) is planning to bring back 65,000 cans of beer from Afghanistan. According to a report from the German news magazine Der Spiegel, about 20,000 liters ofÂ beer, as well as 340 bottles of wine and Sekt (sparkling wine), and an unknown amount of shandy have to come back to Germany. Commander Ansgar Meyer imposed a ban on German soldiers drinking alcohol during the last part of the withdrawal from the country. The report said it is because of the potential for attacks in the area. The German army was also not allowed to sell the alcohol to local troops for legal and religious reasons, according to Operations Command.
