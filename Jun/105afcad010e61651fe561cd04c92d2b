On this week's Meet the Germans, Rachel Stewart rummages through the trash, visits an old coal mine and meets a Fridays for Future activist to try and find out if Germany deserves its "green" reputation. Rachel moved from the UK to Germany in 2016. As a relative newcomer she casts a fresh eye over German clichés and shares her experiences of settling into German life. Every two weeks she explores a new topic for Meet the Germans — from unusual bans to meaty cuisine or haunted castles. Follow Meet the Germans on Instagram.
