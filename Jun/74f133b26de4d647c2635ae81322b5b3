German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is scheduled to visit Israel between June 30 and July 2 to hold talks with the country's new government. The purpose of the state visit is to "honor and strengthen the friendship and special partnership between Germany and Israel," Steinmeier's office said on Monday, adding that the president would also join in talks on "the future of Israeli society" and "shared challenges." The trip "offers the opportunity to intensify the political exchange of views on the current situation in the region with the new Israeli government." Steinmeier's trip with his wife, Elke Büdenbender, will make up for a visit originally planned last year but postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
