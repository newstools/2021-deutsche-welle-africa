The European Union has agreed to a fishing deal with the UK that could be worth 333 million pounds ($472 million, €388 million) to Britain over the next two years. The Council of Europe approved the UK′s fishing opportunities and deep-sea stocks for 2020 and 2021 on Friday as part of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The post-Brexit fishing deal aims to provide security to the fishing industry on both sides of the English Channel. It will now be turned into EU legislation and opens the door to future negotiations on fishing rights.
