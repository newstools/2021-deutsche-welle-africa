Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Monday that the Euro 2020 final should be moved from Wembley Stadium in London to Rome. The UK has seen a rise in coronavirus cases due to the spread of the delta variant, first identified in India. "I advocate that the final should not take place in a country in which the risk of infection is very big," Draghi told reporters. Draghi made the comments at a press conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Friday his top priority is keeping the "country safe from Covid."

"We are of the opinion that without Turkey we cannot move forward." The deal requires Turkey to prevent Syrian refugees from entering in the EU, with the 27-member bloc providing financial support to Ankara in exchange. Turkey currently shelters over three million refugees. Draghi said the EU should be more present in North Africa to better deal with migration. Draghi also thanked Merkel for backing EU structural reforms and expressed support for strong, lasting relations between the two countries. It was Draghi's first trip to Berlin since becoming prime minister. wd/rt (Reuters, AP)
