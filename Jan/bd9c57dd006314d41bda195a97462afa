With the help of Alex, a Bayern Munich fan, and Anna-Maria, a St. Pauli fan, as well as our in-house experts Matt Ford and Felix Tamsut, the very first episode of Project Fussball takes a deep dive into how the coronavirus has affected German football fans. Known for its vibrant and socially-engaged fan culture, German fanshave had it tough while stadiums are closed. We hear how Alex and Anna-Maria felt at the beginning of the pandemic, why the absence of fans has resulted in bigger questions about the game and what the future of being a fan in Germany might look like.
