Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf will resign on Monday, a senior official said, days after he criticized US President Donald Trump over the Capitol riots last week. "I am stepping down as your Acting Secretary," Wolf said in a statement to the DHS. "Unfortunately, this action is warranted by recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as Acting Secretary." Wolf will be replaced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor as the next Acting Secretary until President-elect Joe Biden's administration takes over.
