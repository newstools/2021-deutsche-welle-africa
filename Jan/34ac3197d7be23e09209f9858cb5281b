AstraZeneca has pulled out of meeting with the European Union to discuss delayed vaccine commitments to the bloc, a European Commission spokesperson said on Wednesday. Dana Spinant confirmed earlier reports by the Reuters and AP news agencies that the firm had pulled out of tonight's meetng with EU officials. "The representative of AstraZeneca has anounced this morning that their particpation is not happening," she told journalists. A senior Commisson official told DW that they still expected the firm to take part in a meeting "in due course." The British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant immediately denied it had withdrawn from the talks. "We can confirm we have not pulled out, we will be attending the meeting with EU officials later today," an AstraZeneca spokeswoman said in a statement. Executives were set to hold talks with the European Commission, which negotiated the vaccine deals, to explain the delay in deliveries. The European Medicines Agency, which is based in Amsterdam, will take a decision on whether to approve the jab for use in the 27-member bloc on Friday.
