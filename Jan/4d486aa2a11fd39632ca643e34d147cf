US President Joe Biden will renew the COVID-19 travel ban on most non-US citizens who have recently been in the European Union, the UK, and Brazil, a seniorÂ White House official said Sunday. The ban will come into effect on Monday and will be extended to travelers who have been to South Africa, amid warnings that a new, more transmissible coronavirus variant was spreading in the US, the official said. Last week, Biden tightened mask-wearing rules and ordered mandatory quarantine for people flying into the United States. Former President Donald Trump had announced in the last days of his term that travel restrictions from much of Europe and Brazil would be lifted. But the Biden administration said it would reverse the order. "We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one," Biden said on Thursday. Australia's medical regulator formally authorized the use of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine to get the green light in the country.

Australia has an agreement for 10 million doses of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine and an option to buy more if supplies allow. Health Minister Greg Hunt said Monday the country overall had secured 140 million vaccines, one of the highest dosing rates per head of population in the world. The country is aiming to complete the vaccination program by October. New Zealand's first case of coronavirus in the community for more than two months has been identified as the South African variant, Health Minister Chris Hipkins said Monday.

Authorities believe that the woman may have been infected during quarantine by a person on the same floor of the hotel who tested positive two days before she left. The 56-year-old tested positive on Saturday, 10 days after completing her mandatory two weeks in isolation. "She didn't talk about respiratory symptoms, it was more muscle aches, so she may not have been sharing or spreading the virus much," Hipkins said. "I don't think that's peculiar to this variant, it's just how it was expressed in this woman."

Bolivia's interim president Jeanine Anez announced on July 10 that she had the virus. "I feel well, I feel strong, I am going to keep working remotely from my isolation, and I want to thank all the Bolivians who are working to help us in this health crisis," the leader tweeted at the time.
