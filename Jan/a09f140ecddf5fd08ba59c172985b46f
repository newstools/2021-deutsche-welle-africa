The COVID-19 representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday said Germany needed to summon the spirit of football coach Jürgen Klopp in its fight against the coronavirus. In an exclusive interview with German news agency DPA, David Nabarro called on lawmakers to show more unity — and to take inspiration from the Liverpool coach. To get everyone behind the coronavirus protection measures he said Germany needed a "Klopp effect" in reference to the former Borussia Dortmund trainer. "Klopp knows how to touch people and bring people together," Nabarro said. "I'm sure he would have good ideas."

But those protesting the lockdown are invigorated when politicians argue, the health official said. "The group of opponents of coronavirus protection measures is small, but when politicians argue, it grows," Nabarro said. Germany, he said, got off to a good start last year with rigorous protective measures but "Why haven't they maintained the thoroughness?" Nabarro asked. "It's almost as if rich countries thought they could get through the pandemic without hard work." Europe could learn from countries like Thailand, Cambodia, Australia and New Zealand, he posited.

"The virus is an adversary of humanity, not of individual countries," he said. "This virus will defeat us if we are not united."
