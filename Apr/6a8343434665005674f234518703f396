Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Sunday offered his condolences to the families of those lost in a submarine accident four days ago. Authorities have confirmed that the KRI Nanggala 402 submarine sunk, and that the 53 crew members are assumed to have died. "The army and navy have changed the status of the KRI Nanggala 402 submarine from having lost contact to being 'sub-sunk' or drowned," Joko told reporters. "All of us Indonesians express our deep sorrow over this tragedy, especially to the families of the submarine crew." Joko said rescuers were still expending their best efforts to recover the craft and its crew. He offered his hopes and prayers, and wished the families patience and strength. The 44-year-old West-German-built submarine lost contact while taking part in torpedo drills off the coast of Bali on Wednesday. It failed to surface and only had enough oxygen for the crew to survive up to 72 hours. Rescue teams announced on Saturday they had found objects such as prayer mat fragments, a piece of the torpedo system and a bottle of periscope lubricant near the submarine's last known location. This led them to believe that the vessel had broken open.
