Police in southern Germany said they nabbed a team of slumbering intruders who fell asleep on the job after they broke into a kindergarten early Wednesday. The trio, aged 17, 21 and 28, were found dozing by a teacher who had arrived for work at the nursery school, in the German town of Schopfheim. She alerted police, who apprehended the men and detained them in connection with a burglary in the area. The kindergarten had apparently been searched and a nearby garden shed appeared to have been broken into. An office nearby was also broken into during night, with several items of office furniture forcibly opened. The burglary caused some €12,000 ($14,200) of damage, police in the nearby city of Freiburg said. Officers found no stolen items among the group's possessions, and there was no indication that they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The older two men were released pending investigations, while the youth was placed in care.
