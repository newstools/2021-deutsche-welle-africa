The meeting was postponed from Wednesday after a last-minute NATO summit was called.

Turkey ultimately backed down from its exploration after it was threatened with EU sanctions. EU allies also dispatched ships to the disputed area to back Greece's claims. The two sides have also clashed over the island of Cyprus and the flow of refugees between the neighboring countries.
