Indian regulators have approved the use of the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Monday. The body — which markets the vaccine abroad — said that the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) had approved the use of Sputnik V. However, the DCGI was yet to make a statement, despite recommendations by an expert panel. "India, the world’s 2nd most populous nation, became the 60th country to register #SputnikV after positive results of local Phase 3 clinical study. Sputnik V is now authorized in 60 countries with a population of over 3 [billion] people," a tweet from Sputnik V’s official account read. Earlier on Monday, the Indian media had reported that the expert committee of India's drug regulator had recommended granting an Emergency Use Authorization to Sputnik V. The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) was deliberating on an application by pharmaceutical company Dr Reddy's Laboratories, that had sought the authorization for Sputnik V.

On Monday, India overtook Brazil to become the second worst-hit nation in the world, in overall terms, reporting a daily record of 168,912 new cases. The country’s total COVID-19 caseload stood at 13.53 million — surpassing Brazil's 13.45 million — according to data from Johns Hopkins University. India has administered some 105 million shots among a population of over 1.3 billion, so far. Sputnik V, if approved by the DCGI, will the third coronavirus vaccine authorized for use in the country, after the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known in India as Covishield, and the indigenous Covaxin. dvv/msh (dpa, Reuters)
