"The working platform with 12 people is 1,200 meters (3,900 feet) from ground level and the underground terrain is complex, making rescue difficult," CCTV said. Coal mines in China are among the world's most dangerous, with explosions and gas leaks a regular occurrence. Mining accidents in eastern Shandong province in January and the southwest city of Chongqing in December killed more than 30 miners.
