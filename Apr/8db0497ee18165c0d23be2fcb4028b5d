This should be a good time for the Alternative for Germany (AfD), if only because, with Chancellor Angela Merkel no longer a candidate in September's election, Germany has no choice but to choose an alternative. The built-in uncertainty of Germany's political future has been exacerbated in recent months by a series of legacy-scarring crises marking Merkel's final year in power and eroded trust in the political establishment. As political analyst and far-right specialist Florian Hartleb noted, the coronavirus pandemic has given the AfD opportunities. "Germany is in a big legitimacy crisis," Hartleb told DW. "There's a dramatic decline in support for the government and especially Angela Merkel, because of the lack of vaccines and other issues. This is the perfect opportunity for the AfD, which is the party against the grand coalition." Berlin's AfD spokesman Ronald Gläser says the government's current struggles could create a new opportunity: "As the dissatisfaction with the coronavirus measures grows, as we're seeing right now, we have the potential to make greater gains," he said. "A blind man with a stick could see that the government is making decisions that contradict any common sense." But recent elections suggest the AfD has not used this potential.The party lost around a third of its vote-share in the Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate elections in mid-March — ending up at below 10% in both states, down from just 15% five years ago. The latest opinion polls see the AfD stagnating at 11% On April 10-11, the party will re-group in Dresden, one of its eastern German strongholds, to finalize its manifesto, and to come up with a strategy to revive its momentum in Germany's "super election year," which will culminate in the general election on September 26. Hopes will be pinned on the next state election in Saxony-Anhalt in early June, where the AfD took a quarter of the votes in 2016. But observers are expecting to see a major power struggle between more moderate and more right-wing extremist representatives. Gläser insists the party is in a good place. "Of course a few people are dissatisfied with the loss of votes, but honestly, it wasn't really surprising," he told DW. For one thing, he argued, the AfD was never likely to repeat what he called the "phenomenal" successes of 2016, when the new party gathered up to a quarter of the vote in a series of regional elections. Those successes came on the back of the refugee crisis that dominated that year, when the AfD was able to bend the political debate around its own nationalist and at times openly racist views, going on to become Germany's main opposition party in the Bundestag in 2017 with 12.6% of the national vote. Thuringia's far right extremist leader Björn Höcke has many fans in the party That local friction has extended to the national party, because another prominent figure in the Baden-Württemberg AfD happens to be Jörg Meuthen, one of the two co-chairpeople of the national AfD. The upcoming party conference is likely to be the stage for a major power battle. Meuthen is considered one of the AfD's most high-profile "moderates," a group that has historically been an endangered species: Previous AfD leaders such as Bernd Lucke and Frauke Petry have been excised from the party for opposing the party's more extreme factions. In an attempt to avoid a split Meuthen reached out to the AfD radicals in 2017, assuring them that "the wing is and will remain to be an integral part of our party." He changed his tune when the Wing was formally disbanded last year because the Verfassungsschutz (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, decided to put the group under heightened surveillance. Ex-press officer Christian Lüth had already faced demotion for past contentious comments before being caught on camera talking to a right-wing YouTube video blogger. "The worse things get for Germany, the better they are for the AfD," Lüth allegedly said, before turning his focus to migrants. "We can always shoot them later, that's not an issue. Or gas them, as you wish. It doesn't matter to me." Co-chairman Alexander Gauland said the German national soccer team's defender Jerome Boateng might be appreciated for his performance on the pitch — but people would not want "someone like Boateng as a neighbor." He also argued Germany should close its borders and said of an image showing a drowned refugee child: "We can't be blackmailed by children's eyes." Alice Weidel generally plays the role of "voice of reason" for the far-right populists, but she, too, is hardly immune to verbal miscues. Welt newspaper, for instance, published a 2013 memo allegedly from Weidel in which she called German politicians "pigs" and "puppets of the victorious powers in World War II." Weidel initially claimed the mail was fake, but now admits its authenticity. German border police should shoot at refugees entering the country illegally, the former co-chair of the AfD told a regional newspaper in 2016. Officers must "use firearms if necessary" to "prevent illegal border crossings." Communist East German leader Erich Honecker was the last German politician who condoned shooting at the border. The head of the AfD in the state of Thuringia made headlines for referring to Berlin's Holocaust memorial as a "monument of shame" and calling on the country to stop atoning for its Nazi past. The comments came just as Germany enters an important election year — leading AfD members moved to expel Höcke for his remarks. Initially, the AfD campaigned against the euro and bailouts — but that quickly turned into anti-immigrant rhetoric. "People who won't accept STOP at our borders are attackers," the European lawmaker said in 2016. "And we have to defend ourselves against attackers," she said — even if this meant shooting at women and children. Pretzell, former chairman of the AfD in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and husband to Frauke Petry, wrote, "These are Merkel's dead," shortly after news broke of the deadly attack on the Berlin Christmas market in December 2016. The member of parliament in Germany's eastern state of Saxony made waves in early 2016 with an inquiry into how far the state covers the cost of sterilizing unaccompanied refugee minors. Thousands of unaccompanied minors have sought asylum in Germany, according to the Federal Association for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees (BumF) — the vast majority of them young men. Poggenburg, former head of the AfD in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, has also raised eyebrows with extreme remarks. In February 2017, he urged other lawmakers in the state parliament to join measures against the extreme left-wing in order to "get rid of, once and for all, this rank growth on the German racial corpus" — the latter term clearly derived from Nazi terminology. During a campaign speech in Eichsfeld in August 2017, AfD election co-candidate Alexander Gauland said that Social Democrat parliamentarian Aydan Özoguz should be "disposed of" back to Anatolia. The German term, "entsorgen," raised obvious parallels to the imprisonment and killings of Jews and prisoners of war under the Nazis. Gauland was roundly criticized for a speech he made to the AfD's youth wing in June 2018. Acknowledging Germany's responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi era, he went on to say Germany had a "glorious history and one that lasted a lot longer than those damned 12 years. Hitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history." Author: Dagmar Breitenbach, Mark Hallam And this March, a BfV investigation concluded that in fact the entire AfD was "a case of suspected far-right extremism" and could be put under strict surveillance. The AfD has so far successfully challenged the decision in court. Meuthen has attempted to install a firewall against the far-right extremists in the party, sometimes initiating expulsion proceedings against politicians who openly expressed racist views: Most prominent amongst these is the notorious Björn Höcke, the leader of the AfD in Thuringia, whose statements have exposed an overtly racist world-view. Höcke has gathered a group around him known as "The Wing," the AfD's hardcore group, which, according to Germany's domestic intelligence agency, is essentially a right-wing extremist party within a party. It happens to enjoy the support of up to 40% of AfD members. Meuthen failed to remove either Höcke or the Wing — partly because the rest of the AfD's national leaders, including the two parliamentary leaders Weidel and Alexander Gauland, and Meuthen's co-chairman Tino Chrupalla, believe the "wing" is vital for the party to maintain its far-right voter base. Gauland once famously even described Höcke as "the center of the party." Jörg Meuthen launched a surprise attack against his opponents during the a party conference in November 2020 "Basically, Jörg Meuthen is clearly under fire within the party, and he's not powerful enough to kick the Wing out, which he wanted to do," said Hartleb. "But if I was advising the AfD — which I'm not, of course — I would say: Keep silent because the more they keep silent the more votes they're getting. They lost a lot of energy with these internal struggles." So while the upcoming party gathering formally is about the election manifesto, 100 party members have announced that they want Meuthen to be removed as party leader at the gathering in Dresden. And there is pressure to decide now on the top candidate for the September general election — something Meuthen would like to delay. Despite the stain of extremism and the insistence of all other parties that they will never cooperate with the AfD, the party is far from struggling, according to Hartleb. The party has shown no sign of backing down from extremist rhetoric. In the latest draft of the AfD election manifesto, unpublished but sent to delegates of the upcoming party conference, the party has intensified anti-immigrant rhetoric since the last manifesto in 2017: The emphasis is on plans to deport more immigrants and introduce schemes to send refugees back to countries of origin as quickly as possible. For his part, Gläser insists that the AfD maintains a solid presence in Germany's political debate, despite no longer having an all-consuming immigration crisis to build popularity on. "Our basic criticisms of European bailouts, of illegal mass immigration, of gender politics, of the abolition of fuel-burning cars, still hold," he said. "There are plenty of issues. The point will come when they return to the daily agenda."

It started out in 2013 as a Euroskeptic party dominated by academics, and went on to capitalize on anti-immigration sentiment  in 2015 making gains with the economically disadvantaged. "The AfD is much more than just the party of the losers of modernization," Hartleb said. "Many middle-class people vote for the AfD too." "The classic AfD voter is an older working man with a mid-level education qualification," said Gläser. "But we also see ourselves as having a program for everyone, just as all parties do. We're not fixed on certain issues or groups." But voter analysis by pollster infratest dimap following the recent state elections suggests that the AfD may have lost the crucial weapon it had in 2016-2017: Its polarizing presence caused a boost in turnout, which it benefitted from — more non-voters went for the AfD than other parties. But this time around, the Greens appear to have won the battle to attract the most non-voters in the first elections of the year.
