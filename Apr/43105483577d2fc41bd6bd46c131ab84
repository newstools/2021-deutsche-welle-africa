Russia has started pulling its troops back from Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Moscow in 2014, local news agencies reported on Friday.

But the build-up of tens of thousands of army personnel had alarmed Western governments, sparking fears of a wider military intervention by Moscow. Russia has a number of military assets stationed in the area EU officials estimated that the number was as high as 100,000 near the border as well as in Crimea. The Russian military carried out a series of drills there earlier this week, before announcing their end on Thursday. Russia has used troops in unmarked uniforms in the annexed region in the past, and also supported separatists in an ongoing conflict in Ukraine's east. The fighting there has cost some 14,000 lives despite a series of cease-fires. Hours after the end to the exercises was announced, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Zelensky was welcome in Moscow anytime to discuss bilateral relations. But he said Zelensky should discuss the surge in fighting with separatist leaders in Ukraine's breakaway republics. jf/rt (Reuters, AFP, Interfax)
