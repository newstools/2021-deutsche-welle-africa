Protesters clashed with Minnesota police in the city of Brooklyn Center on Sunday, soon after the death of a 20-year-old man who was shot by the police. Daunte Wright's family confirmed his death. According to local police, officers stopped an individual on Sunday afternoon, after determining that there was an outstanding warrant for the driver. When they tried to arrest him, he reentered the vehicle and continued driving. A shot fired by a police officer hit the driver but the vehicle continued to travel several blocks before striking another vehicle. He died at the scene. Police said the officers' body cameras wereÂ activated during the incident.
